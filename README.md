## Problem Statement
 
Develop a solution to safeguard the security and privacy of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to
 
keep sensitive patient information safe.
 
 
## Description
 
    As the healthcare industry increasingly relies on digital platforms for storing patient information it is
 
important to store the patient data securely. The solution should be able to store health information
 
such that unauthorized access and manipulation is not possible. The integrity of patient data should be
 
maintained to help increase confidence in the privacy of health records.
 
    As a solution to addressing these problem we are developing the web application called as #####. In these application we are providing 3-factor authentication method for authenticating the Doctors for accessing patients records. While maintaining this user is able to view the log of records.
 
    For the doctors, first he has to register himself while registering he must be authenticated by its Biometric Recognition (Facial Recognition). Users records gets enrypted by Encryption algorithm and stored in database. We are also providing the one security feature in that to access the patients records Doctor will have to enter a security key which is encrypted sent to patients whenever doctor is accessing their records. 
 
 
## Features
 
- Records are stored in encrypted format.
 
- 3-Factor Authentication for Doctor (Normal Login, Security Key,Biometric (Facial Recognition)).
